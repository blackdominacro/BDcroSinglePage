// HERE IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENDS :O 
// main.scss is compailed into main.css with all included assets.
// You dont have to edit this file,if you need something styled do it in a proper scss file.

// TIP: in terminal ( if you dont use linux you are dead to me) in scss folder structure compile 
// your scss to css using compass with command compass --watch scss/main.sccc css/main.css
